### 💬 About Me
I'm not just learning how to write automated tests I'm learning how to think like an engineer.

I'm someone who figures things out. I’m creative, reliable, and I care about building things that *actually* work. Whether I’m writing Selenium scripts or exploring new tools like Cypress, Postman, or GitHub Actions I bring structure, passion, and sharp attention to detail.

I’m currently transitioning into tech, finishing my BSc IT (online), and preparing for my ISTQB certification but more than anything, I’m building *my own understanding* of how quality, automation, and systems come together.

This space is a record of that journey.

### 🔧 Projects In Progress
Here’s what I’m building to learn deeply and stand out:

| 🛠 Project | 🚀 Description | 📁 Status |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| `smart-qa-framework` | End-to-end UI + API testing with Selenium, REST Assured, and GitHub Actions | In progress |
| `flaky-test-detector` | Tool to auto-detect and log flaky tests across multiple runs | Research phase |
| `lighthouse-performance-ci` | Performance & accessibility checks integrated into CI/CD | Coming soon |
| `mock-api-test-suite` | REST API mock server + automation suite to test edge cases | Live soon |

*(You’ll see them here as I build, break, and rebuild.)*
